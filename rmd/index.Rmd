<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Polites<sup>1</sup> is a Java based tool that enables the automation of complete OHDSI implementations for either standalone (non-Docker) or Broadsea<sup>2</sup> based OHDSI deployments.  Broadsea provides a turn-key solution with unparalleled ease of use and a standardized stable production deployment that includes an instance of a Common Data Model replete with test data in PostgreSql.  “Broadsea 3.0 provides a flexible approach to deploying OHDSI tools that are typically challenging to set up, and establishes a framework for supporting new OHDSI tools to come.  Any site, regardless of size, can deploy a wide range of OHDSI tools on a laptop or a production server”<sup>3</sup> using Broadsea.  However, after initial deployment there are customizations that most implementations will want to make to create a production, test, or development instance of an OHDSI implementation.  This includes the creation of an independent instance of the CDM that could be in the existing Broadsea instance of PostgreSql or in any of the other data management systems supported by OHDSI (including Oracle, Microsoft Sql Server, PostgreSql, Databricks, etc.).  Creation of this environment entails numerous steps that need to integrated and executed flawlessly.  This process can be time consuming and fraught with errors and includes the creation of multiple databases and/or schemas and other database objects, creation of multiple users with detailed specific privileges, the creation of meta data such as the CDM source record and webapi records, the importing of vocabulary data, the creation of sequences for primary keys for ETL processes, the creation of indexes and constraints, the importing of data, and the running of other processes such as Achilles.  Polites provides a way to execute all of these processes and an interface that allows the processes to be selected individually or run in groups.

<!-- Prerequisites Installation -->
<h3>Prerequisites Installation</h3>

<!-- Run the YesPolitesInstaller -->
<h4>Run the YesPolitesInstaller</h4>
All of the prerequisites for Broadsea and Polites can be installed using the YesPolitesInstaller. 
Download the 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sa66nfp7ijmvocyt0gf6h/YesPolitesInstaller-1.0.016.exe?rlkey=703p9nz8c3p2pi3rc25gqoa29&dl=1">
  YesPolitesInstaller.exe
</a> file and run it. 
Downloading and running this file does take a few minutes. 
The installer creates a directory called _YES_POLITES that contains resources needed for Broadsea and other OHDSI tools 
and also installs and configures other required resources. 
Overall, the installer does the following: 

<ul>
  <li>
    Installs a git client that will be used to download and install Broadsea and other resources. 
    (the installation will also configure the certificates used by this client) 
  </li>

  <li>
    Installs Java 8 and Java 11
  </li>

  <li>
    Installs a number of .bat files including the following:
    <ul>
      <li>jv: Changes the Java version to 8 or 11</li>
      <li>git-detials: gives the git information about the current repository
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Downloads a copy of the installer for Docker 
    (this insures that all instances of Polites are using the same version of Docker). 
  </li>

  <li>
    Downloads installers for the databases supported by polites
  </li>

  <li>
    Installs the correct version of R
  </li>

  <li>
    Downloads installers for RStudio and RTools
  </li>

  <li>
    Installs database specific dependencies 
    (e.g. installs and configures the JDBC DLL required by Sql Server and updates environment variables to point to the correct version of this DLL)
  </li>

  <li>
    Updates the system environment variables to put required tools on the system path
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Install Docker -->
<h4>Install Docker</h4>
Navigate to C:\\_YES_POLITES\\tools\\docker and run the Docker Desktop Installer.exe file. 
Accept all of the default values. 
<br/>
<img src="./img/index/install-docker.png" />
<br/>

<!-- Install Broadsea -->
<h4>Install Broadsea</h4>
Broadsea can be installed and configured by running the C:\\_YES_POLITES\\workspace\\install-broadsea.bat file. 
This process will install Broadsea v3.0.0 and update the configuration for the current installation. 
This process also puts the following .bat files in the Broadsea directory. 
These .bat files can be used to manage Broadsea. 
<ul>
  <li>
    start.bat<br/>
    This script will start Broadsea
  </li>
  <li>
    stop.bat<br/>
    This script will stop Broadsea
  </li>
  <li>
    clean-docker.sh<br/>
    This script will delete all images, containers, and volumes from Docker
  </li>
  <li>
    reset.bat<br/>
    This script will clear Docker of all images, containers, and volumes 
    but will preserve the data stored in the Postgres database used by Broadsea
  </li>
  <li>
    show-docker.bat<br/>
    This script will show the images, containers, and volumes that exist in Docker
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Start Broadsea -->
<h4>Start Broadsea</h4>
Before running Broadsea you will need to start Docker Desktop 
(there should be a shortcut on your desktop from the initial installation). 
To run Broadsea, open a cmd prompt, navigate to C:\\_YES_POLITES\\workspace\\Broadsea 
and then execute the start.bat script. 

<h2>Platform Details</h2>

Support for Microsoft Sql Server, PostgreSql, and Databricks is targeted for the completion of the first relase of Polites. 
This release of Polites currently supports Microsoft Sql Server.  
Processes specific to the installation for each platform are given in the pages listed below. 
Execute the process for the platform you are targeting.

<h2>Polites Installation</h2>
<p>
  Polites is installed by Downloading the zip file from the latest release, 
  Unziping the files, and then running the polites.bat file 
  (which runs "java -jar polites.jar" with some additional performance parameters). 
  Releases of Polites can be found at 
  <a href="https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/polites/releases">https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/polites/releases</a>.
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/index/download.png" />
</p>
<p>
  After downloading and extracting the zip file you should see the following files. 
  <br/>
  <img src="img/index/extracted.png" />
  <br/>
  The auth folder contains two files: app.properties and sqlserver-demo-app.properties. 
  The sqlserver-demo-app.properties file contains and example configuration for Microsoft SqlServer 
  that should work out of the box. The app.properties file contains a single line 
  that points to the actual configuration file. This alows the configuration file 
  and any sensitive information this file might contain such as passwords to exist 
  anywhere that is accessible by the file system. 
</p>


<!--
*
* Polites Configuration
*
-->

<h2>Polites Configuration</h2>
<p>
  All configuration for the Polites application is in a single configuration file. 
  This configureation file is pointed to by the ./auth/app.properties file as shown below. 
  Note the path to the configuration file can be on the class path 
  or can be an absolute reference (e.g. C:\\path\\to\\myfile.properties). 
  The downloaded zip file contains an exmple configuration for a Microsoft SqlServer implementation 
  that should work out of the box. 
  Modify this file to fit your specific implementation.
